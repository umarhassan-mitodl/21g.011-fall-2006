As a Communication-Intensive course, this subject requires 20 pages in writing. Students were required to write three papers of 7-8 pages each in addition to weekly responses to the readings and films.

Examples of student papers are provided below; they are courtesy of the author and are used here with permission.

## Paper 1: Memoir-Writing in a Specific Cultural Context

Based on the films and readings in the Neo-Modern Narratives section (Module 1) of this course, develop a part of a memoir for a character you feel would fit into this genre. Situate the character in one of the several socio-political and cultural contexts that we have discussed in class, based on the film narratives we have studied.

Keep in mind your character does not have to be of Indian heritage.

Develop the character and his/her cicumstances and write 7-8 pages from the point of view of your character in the style of a memoir.

## Paper 2: Thesis Paper: Comparative Analysis

We've studied how Indian film and literature has been adapted from other literary texts (see Module 3 of this course). Choose either *Parineeta, Omkara*, or *Maya Memsaab* and develop a thesis paper to discuss the significance of literary versus cinematic strategies of your chosen film and the original text from which it was adapted. Your analysis should be 7-8 pages long.

## Paper 3: Creative Work: Dialogue-Writing

Consider in particular the films and readings from the Engaging with Hollywood section (Module 4) of this course. Based on any one scene from one of the films we have discussed during this period, create an alternative scenario for your original text, while keeping within the parameters dictated by the original story and characters.
